# Eniac A/B Testing Project

## Overview
This repository contains the final project for Eniac's A/B testing. The project focuses on improving iPhone 13 sales by increasing the Click-Through Rate (CTR) of the ‚ÄúSHOP NOW‚Äù button through A/B testing. This repository includes a detailed analysis, visual interpretation, and relevant scripts.

## Project Structure
- `Eniac AB Test.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the full analysis and code for the A/B test.
- `chart.png`: Image file with the A/B test results.
- `data/`: Folder containing sample datasets used for the analysis.
- `notebook/`: Folder containing notebook used for the analysis.
- `results/`: Folder containing the results and plots generated from the analysis.

## Highlights
- **Data Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis using Jupyter Notebook, providing insights into user behavior and engagement.
- **Visualization**: Clear and informative visual representations of A/B testing results.
- **Statistical Methods**: Application of statistical techniques, including chi-square tests, to validate the results.
- **Reproducibility**: Ensuring reproducibility of results with clearly defined steps and code.

## Challenges
- **Data Collection**: Ensuring accurate and unbiased data collection for the A/B test.
- **Analysis Accuracy**: Applying appropriate statistical methods to derive meaningful conclusions.
- **User Engagement**: Designing effective experiments to measure user engagement accurately.

**Personal Opinion**: 
As per performed Chi-square test to check for statistical significance, version C comes as the winner.
Howvever, between Versions A & C there is a marginal difference as compared to when comparing with Versions B & D. Hence would suggest to re-assess the metrics.
